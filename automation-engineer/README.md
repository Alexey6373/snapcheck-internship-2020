### Coding challenge

Query Spotify (API) and grab a list of album names for any given artist. Bonus points if the script allows the user to specify the artist!

Create a playlist on your account if you don't already have one. Write a script that queries Spotify for the playlist and returns all tracks/songs in the playlist.

**Task**: write a script that obtains a list of the top tracks for an artist and see if any of those songs exist in your playlist.

> If you don't have an existing playlist, just create one with random artists and use it as your data set.
