### Problem Statement
The Clipper card is a reloadable contactless smart card used for electronic transit fare payment in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

The clipper card system has remained unchanged for years. The cost of infrastructure, the potential of losing the transit card, and the ease of gaming the system by swiping your card for others has cost the transit authorities millions of dollars and leaves much to be desired from the user experience.

The clipper card team is actively engaged in developing new system and processes that will ease life of daily traveler, out of town visitors, senior citizens and school/college going students (grades 6 and above) who use public transport system. 

The new system will be rolled out Q3 2020. It consists of mobile app and website to purchase and validate tickets. Good bye plastic! Tickets can be purchased directly through mobile app or web (responsive, mobile friendly), QR code is validated at the transport entrance. Type of tickets are available are Monthly pass, full day, half-day, student pass, and weekend pass.
