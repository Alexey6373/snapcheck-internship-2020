## Clipper Card

The Clipper card is a reloadable contactless smart card used for electronic transit fare payment in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The clipper card card system has remained unchanged for years. The cost of infrastructure, the potential 
of losing the transit card, and the ease of gaming the system by swiping your 
card for others has cost the transit authorities millions of dollars and leaves much to be desired from the user experience.
Design a new system that allows a daily user who uses the bay area public transport or an-out-of-town visitor who will use
the public transport just once, on time, without having a physical clipper card on hand.

**_Constraint_**: Every suggested technology has to be available on the market today.
