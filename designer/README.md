## Clipper Card

### Problem
The Clipper card is a reloadable contactless smart card used for electronic transit fare payment in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The clipper card card system has remained unchanged for years. The cost of infrastructure, the potential 
of losing the transit card, and the ease of gaming the system by swiping your 
card for others has cost the transit authorities millions of dollars and leaves much to be desired from the user experience.


### Proposed solution

Design a new **responsive website** that allows a **daily user** who uses the bay area public transport or **an-out-of-town visitor** 
who will use the public transport just once, without having a physical clipper card on hand. 

### Screens (not in any order)
- Onboarding (email, phone number, typical credit card information)
- Purchase options (single fare, monthly pass)
- Confirmation of receipt
- Renewal of Monthly Pass 
- Login

**_Constraint_**: Every suggested technology has to be available on the market today.

**_Expectations/Hints_**: 

- Design UX and user journey experience through your flow
- Think through on usability 
- Hi-Fi are welcome, but not required
